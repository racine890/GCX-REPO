# GCX-REPOSIORY

REPOSITORY OF REMOTE GCX APPS FOR GC LAUNCHER
Here, we store packages that are used by our desktop Launcher app to download and install automatically some gcx apps.

To share your project, create the gcx, and write the metadata in a text file before sending it to gcenterburkina@gmail.com , and we will be glad to check for it.
Awaited informations are the app title, description, category, icon, hash and hash algorithm.
The sended package will be examined to eliminate security issues.

Fell free to share everything you've made!
