# GCX-REPOSIORY

<b>REPOSITORY OF REMOTE GCX APPS FOR GC LAUNCHER</b><br/>
Here, we store packages that are used by our desktop Launcher app to download and install automatically some gcx apps.<br/><br/>

To share your project, create the gcx, and write the metadata in a text file before sending it to gcenterburkina@gmail.com , and we will be glad to check for it.<br/>
Awaited informations are the app title, description, category, icon, hash and hash algorithm.<br/>
The sended package will be examined to eliminate security issues.<br/><br/>

Fell free to share everything you've made!
